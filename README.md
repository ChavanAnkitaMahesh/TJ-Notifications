# TJ Notifications
TJ Notifications is an extremely powerful and flexible notifications system for Joomla. Currently, supports sending notifications by email but we are planning to supports SMS, push notifications and in-site notifications. Users can also set their preferences to stop receiving certain types of notifications, or change delivery preferences.
